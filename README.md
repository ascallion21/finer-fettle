# Finer Fettle

Finer Fettle is a workout routine newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to workout.

## Why a Newsletter?

I often find app notifications or email reminders are too easy to swipe away or disable. When a notification appears at 10am but you're not free until 6pm, then the notification becomes useless and annoying--you swipe away the notification after reading it and when 6pm rolls around you forget you're supossed to workout. By including the workout in the reminder, the email becomes more useful and less likely to be ignored/deleted. At least, that's the idea :). Finer Fettle allows users to customize when they want to recieve the workout emails. Also, users can use their email client's features to remind them later, or pin the workout, so that it's always there the next time they check their email. Unlike app notifications which disappear forever when swiped away.
