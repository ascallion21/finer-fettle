# A Workout a Day

A Workout a Day is a workout routine newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to work out.


## Features

- Customizable workout splits, workout intensity, and rest days. 
- Workouts are simplified for users who are new to fitness to build consistency and reduce injury risk.
- Exercises are chosen based on what equipment you have access to â€” no pullups if you don't have a pullup bar or gymnastic rings.
- Exercises can be progressed or regressed to provide easier or harder variations of each exercise. This also ensures a consistent difficulty curve, so you don't work split squats before squats.
- Exercises can be ignored, no more unwanted burpees!
- Exercises can be set to refresh after a day or several months, depending on your preferred exercise variety.
- Keeps track of how much weight you are able to lift with each exercise.
- Built-in deload weeks that automatically adjust your workout to reduce the strain placed upon your muscles that week.
- Keeps track of how often each muscle is being worked over time and will automatically adjust workouts to limit muscle imbalances.
- Specify a sport to focus on and get a workout geared more for that sport.
- Specify weak or tight muscles to get additional strengthening and stretching exercises for those areas.
- Workouts can be set to exclude a certain muscle group in the event of an injury, additional rehab exercises will be provided for that muscle group.
- Helpful fitness and wellbeing tips are provided at the end of each workout.
- Optional mobility and stretching emails for days off strength training.


## Why a Newsletter?

Other fitness apps require users to keep track of how often they need to workout and seek the workouts themselves. I find that reminder notifications are too easy to swipe away or disable when they arrive at inconvenient times. Opening a dedicated fitness app can also be intimidating or overwhelming. A Workout a Day sends at most one workout per day and utilizes your email client's features to remind you later, or pin the workout, so that it's always visible when you check your email.

However, emails have their limitations too. A Workout a Day is geared towards new-to-fitness users or users who aren't as inclined to optimize their workout to 100%.
