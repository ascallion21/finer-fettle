# Finer Fettle

Finer Fettle is a workout routine newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to workout.


## Exercises Used

Each exercise variation listed on our site is hand picked to provide an optimal full-body strengthening workout. Coumpound exercises are choosen over isolation exercises--while isolation exercises are better for strengthening, compound exercises are better for preventing muscle imbalances and keeping workout duration down.

## How Workouts are Built

Finer Fettle targets 18 distinct muscle groups that are all critical in building and maintaining a healthy body and posture:
- Abs, 
- Biceps, 
- Deltoids, 
- Pecs,
- Obliques, 
- Traps, 
- Lats, 
- Spinal 
- Erector, 
- Glutes, 
- Hamstrings, 
- Calves, 
- Quads, 
- Triceps, 
- Forearms, 
- Hip Adductors, 
- Hip Flexors
- Rotator Cuffs, 
- Rhomboids, 
- Serratus Anterior

Depending on the user's workout split, the muscle groups are split into different groups for each workout.

### Warmups

#### Dynamic Stretching/Mobility

The first few exercise in the warmup are choosen from the current day's workout split's muscle groups. Warmup exercises are all dynamic exercises. This is meant to both strengthen/stretch the current day's muscle groups, and to provide the user with mobility exercises to improve their posture/mobility.

##### Cardio

The final two exercises in the warmup are always cardio exercises. Warmup cardio exercises are always unweighted pylometrics.  The goal of the two cardio exercises is just to get the heart rate up and get blood flowing for the next strengtheing exercises. 

### Main

The first few exercises in the main section are functional movement exercises. One of:
- Push
- Pull
- Horizontal Push
- Vertical Push
- Horizontal Pull
- Vertical Pull
- Hip Hinge
- Knee Flextion
- Squat
- Lunge
- Rotation/Anti-Rotation

The functional movements worked are determined from the user's workout split. Each day in the workout split is associated with different functional movements, providing an even frequency to each movement.

If the user is new to fitness, the functional movements is all they see. Otherwise, additional exercises are choosen that target each of the muscles determined by the user's workout split. Each day in the workout split is associated with different muscle groups, providing an even frequency to each muscle group. The exercises choosen do not work any functional movements, meaning that they are accessory exercises. The accessory exercises that work unique muscle groups that the functional movement exercises have not worked are included in the main section, the rest are saved for later. 

#### Adjunct

The first exercise in the adjunct section is always a pylometric. This is to get the heart rate back up and the blood flowing again if the user's heart rate drops after completing the main section, and to boost muscle power.

The saved accessory exercises that work duplicate muscle groups as the functional movements are now shown here. The goal of including these is too push the user's large muscles to failure. These accessory exercises are worked at a lwoer,weight, higher duration, intensity.


### Cooldowns

Cooldown exercises are all static exercises. These exercises are choosen from the current day's muscle groups. The gaol of the cooldown exercises are to stretch the strengthened muscles--easing recovery time. Most of the cooldown exercises are yoga poses, which also provide isometric strengthening and open the body up to new movements.

## Why a Newsletter?

I often find app notifications or email reminders are too easy to swipe away or disable. When a notification appears at 10am but you're not free until 6pm, then the notification becomes useless and annoying--you swipe away the notification after reading it and when 6pm rolls around you forget you're supossed to workout. By including the workout in the reminder, the email becomes more useful and less likely to be ignored/deleted. At least, that's the idea :). Finer Fettle allows users to customize when they want to recieve the workout emails. Also, users can use their email client's features to remind them later, or pin the workout, so that it's always there the next time they check their email. Unlike app notifications which disappear forever when swiped away.

Finer Fettle is geared towards new-to-fitness users or users who aren't as inclined to optimize their workout to 100%.
