# A Workout a Day

A Workout a Day is a workout routine newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to work out.

## App

[Download the app](https://github.com/gscanlon21/a-workout-a-day/releases).

## Features

- Customizable workout splits, intensity, and rest days.
- Workouts are simplified for users who are new to fitness to build consistency and reduce injury risk.
- Exercises are chosen based on the equipment you have access to — no pullups if you don't have a pullup bar or gymnastic rings.
- Exercises can be ignored — no more unwanted burpees!
- Exercises can be progressed or regressed to provide easier or harder variations of each exercise. This also ensures a consistent difficulty curve, so you don't work split squats before squats.
- Exercises can be set to refresh after a day or several months, depending on your preferred exercise variety.
- Keeps track of how much weight you are able to lift with each exercise.
- Keeps track of how often each muscle is being worked over time, and will automatically adjust workouts to remove muscle imbalances.
- Built-in deload weeks that automatically adjust your workout to reduce the strain placed upon your muscles that week.
- Optional health and fitness tips.
- Optional mobility workouts for rest days.
- Optional sports, injury prevention, and rehabilitation exercises.

## Why a Newsletter?

Other fitness apps require users to keep track of how often they need to workout and seek the workouts themselves. I find that reminder notifications are too easy to swipe away or disable when they arrive at inconvenient times. Opening a dedicated fitness app can also be intimidating or overwhelming. A Workout a Day sends at most one workout per day and utilizes your email client's features to remind you later, or pin the workout, so that it's always visible when you check your email.

However, emails have their limitations as well. A Workout a Day is geared towards new-to-fitness users or users who aren't as inclined to optimize their workout to 100%.
