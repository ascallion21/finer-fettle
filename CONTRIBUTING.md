## Adding Exercise Variations

### Intensity

#### Proficiency

Main exercise progressions should be at least 10 apart. 

Mobility variations (sa. Lateral Lunge with Overhead Reach) of exercises should be 5 more than their core variation (sa. Lateral Lunge).

#### Isometrics

##### Bilateral Isometrics

Aim for 120s time under tension:

- (0) Endurance: 4x30s
- (1) Hypertrophy: 3x40s
- (2) Strength: 2x60s
- (3) Stabilization: 5x24s 

##### Unilateral Isometrics

Aim for 60s time under tension for each side:

- (0) Endurance: 4x15s
- (1) Hypertrophy: 3x20s
- (2) Strength: 2x30s
- (3) Stabilization: 5x12s


## Adding Instructions

All linked instructions (incl. instruction_locations) should be a short (1-2min) walkthrough of how the exercise should be performed.
