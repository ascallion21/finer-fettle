## Adding Exercise Variations

### Exercises

- Pike and Downward Dog are different exercises.


### Muscles Worked

#### Planks

While front planks primary work the anterior muscle chain and reverse planks work the posterior muscle chain, 
they both work the abs, obliques, and spinal erectors to some degree. 
Shoulders are also engaged, however they are better worked by shoulder isolation exercises.

- Planks strengthen the abs, obliques, spinal erectors, and hip flexors; stabilize the quads and front deltoids.
- Side Planks strengthen the abs, obliques, spinal erectors, glutes and hip adductors; stabilize the side deltoids.
- Reverse Planks strengthen the abs, obliques, spinal erectors, and glutes; stabilize the hamstrings and rear deltoids.
- Quadruped Planks strengthen the abs, obliques, and spinal erectors; stabilize the hip flexors, quads, and front deltoids.
- Reverse Quadruped Planks strengthen the abs, obliques, spinal erectors, and glutes; stabilize the hamstrings and rear deltoids.
- Pike Planks strengthen the abs, deltoids, obliques, spinal erectors, triceps, and serratus anterior; stabilize the forearms, biceps, traps, rhomboids, and rotator cuffs.
- Handstands strengthen the abs, deltoids, obliques, spinal erectors, triceps, and serratus anterior; stabilize the forearms, biceps, traps, rhomboids, and rotator cuffs.

### Intensity

#### Proficiency

Main exercise progressions should be at least 10 apart. 

Mobility variations (sa. Lateral Lunge with Overhead Reach) of exercises should be 5 more than their core variation (sa. Lateral Lunge).

#### Isometrics


##### Bilateral Isometrics

Aim for 120s time under tension:

- (0) Endurance: 4x30s
- (1) Hypertrophy: 3x40s
- (2) Strength: 2x60s
- (3) Stabilization: 5x24s 

##### Unilateral Isometrics

Aim for 60s time under tension for each side:

- (0) Endurance: 4x15s
- (1) Hypertrophy: 3x20s
- (2) Strength: 2x30s
- (3) Stabilization: 5x12s


## Adding Instructions

All linked instructions (incl. instruction_locations) should be a short (1-2min) walkthrough of how the exercise should be performed.
